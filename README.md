# Prototype rover ground station code

## About

This is part of a second iteration of a rover vehicle (the first
being https://github.com/DanCrank/tank-bot-mk1). This repo will
eventually grow into a ground station that can send commands to
the rover, receive telemetry from the rover, and present some kind
of user interface.

The rover code can be found at https://github.com/DanCrank/rover.
